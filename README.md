# EnsembleGeneNoise
Scripts describing Ensemble Gene Noise analysis, see https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.10.035717v1 for details

./DataSciRep
contains annotation data for human genes (gene names, length, etc.) and for human gene ensembles (KEGG, CORUM, etc.)

./ModelsSciRep
contains XGB models used to predict CAP/sepsis mortality and severety of COVID19

./ResultsSciRep
contains Figures generated by the analysis. Throughout the analysis intermediate results will be stored in this folder.
These were removed from the github submission due to their large size (over 10Gb).

./ScriptsSciRep
contains all scripts used for the Ensemble Gene Noise Analysis

./ScriptsSciRep/download_and_prepare_data_CAP_H1N1_COVID19
contains scripts to download and preprocess GSE65682 Affymetrix, GSE21802 Illumina and GSE157103 RNAseq gene expression
for the CAP/Sepsis, H1N1 and COVID19 respectively.

./ScriptsSciRep/Gene_noise_analysis_Fig1_Fig6A
contains scripts to estimate inter-individual gene expression variability (noise) used in Figures 1 and 6A

./ScriptsSciRep/Ensemble_gene_noise
contains scripts to estimate Ensemble Gene Noise

./ScriptsSciRep/WGCNA_analysis
contains scripts to estimate WGCNA gene expression modules

./ScriptsSciRep/XGB_CAP_Sepsis_COVID_models
contains scripts of XGBtree models

./ScriptsSciRep/plot_Figures
contains scripts to plot figures
